            <p>
                <em>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</em> is a romantic comedy anime series based on the manga written and illustrated by Aka Akasaka. The story is centered around the student council of Shuchiin Academy, where two of the brightest students, Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, engage in a psychological war of love. Both are deeply in love with each other but are too proud to confess their feelings, believing that whoever confesses first will lose and become the subordinate in the relationship. As a result, they go to absurd lengths trying to make the other confess first.
