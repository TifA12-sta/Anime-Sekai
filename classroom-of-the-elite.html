            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
               *Classroom of the Elite* is a psychological, mystery-based anime that explores the cutthroat competition within a prestigious high school. The story takes place at the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, where students are ranked by merit and their class performance determines their social standing. Each class competes for points, which can buy anything from luxury items to privileges, and only the top classes get the benefits.
            </p>

                The protagonist, Kiyotaka Ayanokoji, is a seemingly average student in Class D, which is considered the lowest and weakest class. However, as the story unfolds, Kiyotakaâ€™s intelligence and cunning start to surface as he navigates the manipulative and strategic games played by both students and teachers. His classmates, including Suzune Horikita and Kikyou Kushida, each have their own goals and motivations, which adds to the complexity of the narrative.
